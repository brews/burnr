## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version, I put a space between a URL and an escaped bracket in the vignette file 'introduction.Rmd'. R CMD now no longer detects this as a faulty URL.

Note also that the possibly mis-spelled word in DESCRIPTION, 'FHX', is not a misspelling.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu & OS X install, R release
* travis-ci: Ubuntu 12.04 (devel, release, and R 3.2.5) and OSX (R release)
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.

One NOTE mentions that this is the first time this package has been submitted to CRAN. 

## Downstream dependencies
This package has no downstream dependencies.
