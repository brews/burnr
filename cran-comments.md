## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed redundancy in DESCRIPTION title.

* Add citation and additional details for methods in Description section.

* Removed https URLs from hyperlinks in README markdown. Hopefully, should help with connection timed out error from r-pkgs.had.co.nz link.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu & OS X install, R release
* travis-ci: Ubuntu 14.04 (devel, release, and R 3.5.3) and OSX (R release)
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs.
There is one NOTE: "checking CRAN incoming feasibility".
Steven Malevich changed his maintainer email from malevich@email.arizona.edu to sbmalev@gmail.com.
He is still the same person.

## Downstream dependencies
This package has no downstream dependencies.
