An experiment in analyzing forest fire history data files (e.g. FHX2) in R. This is a tool designed for power users and projects with special needs.

This code is still under heavy development. The project might be renamed. We do not promise backwards compatability (sorry). Here be dragons.

This package is not in CRAN (yet). If you'd like to install it, first be sure you have the `devtools` package installed in R. Then, install this package with:

```R
devtools::install_github("ltrr-arizona-edu/burnr")
```

Want to contribute? Great! We're following [Hadley's packaging workflow](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) and [code style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). Fork away.
