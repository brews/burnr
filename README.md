fhxR
====

An experiment in fire history plotting and parsing with FHX data files and R. This will (with luck) be merged into the dplR.

We have a [tutorial on the project's wiki](https://github.com/ltrr-arizona-edu/fhxR/wiki/fhxR-Tutorial).

Please be sure to file any bugs you find with our [bug tracker](https://github.com/ltrr-arizona-edu/fhxR/issues).
