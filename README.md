An experiment in analyzing forest fire history data files (e.g. FHX2) in R. This is a tool designed for power users and projects with special needs.

This code is still under heavy development. The project might be renamed. We do not promise backwards compatability (sorry). Here be dragons.

We have a [tutorial on the project's wiki](https://github.com/ltrr-arizona-edu/fhxR/wiki/fhxR-Tutorial). Code at the bleeding edge of the project should be documented within the source files.

Please file bugs in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/ltrr-arizona-edu/fhxR/issues).
