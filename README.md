A core tool set to analyze forest fire history data (e.g. FHX2) in R. This is designed for power users and projects with special needs.

The project is under heavy development. We do not yet promise backwards compatability (sorry). Hic sunt dracones.

Documentation is included in the code. More information, including a cookbook, can be found on the [project's wiki](https://github.com/ltrr-arizona-edu/burnr/wiki). Note, this is still under construction.

This package is not yet in CRAN. If you'd like to install it, first be sure you have the `devtools` package installed in R. Install `burnr` with:

```R
devtools::install_github("ltrr-arizona-edu/burnr")
```

Be sure to use the `develop` branch, if you want the bleeding edge or if you're a developer.

Want to contribute? Great! We're following [Hadley's packaging workflow](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) and [code style](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html). Fork away.
